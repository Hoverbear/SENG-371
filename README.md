## Project Question
What is the relation between software development methodologies, and development time per feature (ie. patches) release in a software system?

## Methodology
To find the development time per feature, we would use previously existing version tracking software to find the initial commits, to the final commit before patch release, or when its ready for testing. So using an average of common features used in software systems, we could find the approximate due date for each of the features. From here, we can take the element completion time(end day-start day)/estimated completion time(planned end day-start day) ratios for each element in the project, and visualize it.

## Project Milestones

### Milestone 1 - <a href="https://github.com/ycoady/UVic-Software-Evolution/issues/9">Project Setup</a> (January 28)
Defining:
* Project question
* Methodology (including the tools we expect to use)
* Codebases/Systems we will analyze
* Project milestones

### Milestone 2 - <a href="https://github.com/ycoady/UVic-Software-Evolution/issues/10">Data Collection and Experimentation</a> (February 04)
Conducted an experiment based on our research question:
* Came up with an assertion 
* Performed data collection - Defined specific metrics that will help analyze our assertion
* Analyzed the data collection to support/refute the assertion

### Milestone 3 - Data Collection and Experimentation (February 18)
Continuing experiments based on our research question:
* Performed data collection - Defined specific metrics that will help analyze our assertion
* Analyzed the data collection to support/refute the assertion
Begin working on project deliverable for answeringthe project question.

### Milestone 4 - Providing Deliverables (February 24)
Provide deliverables for answering the project question.
