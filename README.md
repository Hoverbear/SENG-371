# SENG-371
What is the relation between software development methodologies, and development time of a software system?

The user would have to manually input the project schedule, or if there's already a schedule in a different software then use that as the input. From the schedule we could either try and determine the methodology, or have the user input it as well. The user should also post their approximate due date for the elements in the schedule. Then over time, take the element completion time(end day-start day)/estimated completion time(planned end day-start day) ratios for each element in the project, and visualize it.
