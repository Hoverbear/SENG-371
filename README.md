# SENG-371
What is the relation between software development methodologies, and development time per feature (ie. patches) release in a software system?

To find the development time per feature, we would use previously existing version tracking software to find the initial commits, to the final commit before patch release, or when its ready for testing. So using an average of common features used in software systems, we could find the approximate due date for each of the features. From here, we can take the element completion time(end day-start day)/estimated completion time(planned end day-start day) ratios for each element in the project, and visualize it.
